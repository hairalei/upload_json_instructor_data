Shake off the dead weight that slows you down. </p><p>Your time is limited, and you have other things going on in your life. More likely than not, you will only get busier as time goes by. </p><p>New technologies show up everyday. Existing ones keep upgrading, adopting new features, switching to new syntaxes. </p><p>For you to stay relevant, you have to keep learning. </p><p>Most importantly, you must do so quickly and easily, without spending too much time or making too much effort. Otherwise, you won't keep up with the rapid tech progress, and your life as a programmer would be too painful as you are constantly struggling with learning something new. </p><p>It seems that you are caught in a dilemma where there is a lot to learn but not enough time to do it. </p><p>The programming world emphasizes reusing codes. You, as a programmer, must \"reuse\" learning experience. The experience of learning one programming technology should enable you to pick up another one with less time and effort. </p><p>In order to do so, you must disperse the mist and remove all the \"unwanted things\" you hide there. </p><p>The \"unwanted things hidden in the mist\" are the insufficient understanding of a coding language or framework. You have never dug deep enough, all you have done is copying what the manual says. When things get complicated, you won't be able to come up with a solution. </p>",

    "Bio": "<p>In the complex maze of learning, the road to comprehension can occasionally be more twisted than necessary. I'm Donatus, a seasoned traveler on these convoluted routes. The countless hours I invested in dissecting complicated problems, only to later discover simpler answers, brought me to an important understanding: the challenge in learning often originates not from the subject matter itself, but from the way it's presented. The roots of misunderstanding were often planted by unnecessarily complex explanations when simple ones would suffice. This insight triggered a crucial question in my mind: \"Why aren't these easier, more intuitive methods imparted to learners right from the beginning?</p><p>This burning question was the impetus that drove me to become an educator. Determined to save students from the unnecessary confusion that I had faced, I sought to redefine the teaching process, to make learning the enjoyable and enlightening journey it should be.</p><p>As a seasoned professional in Computer Science with a rich spectrum of technical and management knowledge, I've held roles across various industries, accumulating a blend of expertise and strategic insight. Today, I employ these skills to demystify complex concepts, presenting them to my students in a clear, understandable manner.</p><p>In my teaching journey spanning various cultural contexts including India, Singapore, and Malaysia, I have worked to make each lesson unique, memorable, and most importantly, effective. I take pride in my approach that bridges theory and practice, ensuring students not only understand but can apply their knowledge. The success of my students post-completion of my courses stands as a testament to the efficacy of my methods.</p><p>I am a firm believer in lifelong learning, a belief reflected in my extensive collection of professional certifications across a wide array of disciplines. This relentless pursuit of knowledge allows me to stay abreast of the latest industry trends and enhance the wealth of information I can offer my students.</p><p>As an educator, my mission is to empower learners with the knowledge and practical skills they need to excel in their chosen fields. I create courses that promote immersive, hands-on learning, firmly believing that true understanding arises from engaging with the material.</p><p>If you value a learning experience that prioritizes clarity and simplicity, then I invite you to join me in this journey of continuous discovery and growth. </p>",

    "Title": "Owner All Things JavaScript",
    "Bio": "<p>I\u00a0have had 25+ years experience in training and\u00a0product development and 20+ years working with JavaScript. I started learning JavaScript when it was a new\u00a0language used for minor affects on a web site. The growth and ubiquitous nature of JavaScript both excites and inspires me.</p><p>I\u00a0currently work as the President and Lead Trainer at All Things JavaScript, a resource for anyone and everyone that hopes to increase their JavaScript skills and move from novice to expert.</p><p>I'm doing what I love most:\u00a0Teaching about technical subjects. It is so important to understand the why, not just the what and how, when it comes to technical subjects. My goal is to help thousands of JavaScript developers to get started and become experts in the field making a great living coding.</p><p>I\u00a0was the co-owner and President of Rapid Intake, an eLearning\u00a0firm. The company was an ideal place for me to apply my training and\u00a0development skills.\u00a0While there I managed all development and professional service related activities. I was heavily involved in the initial development of Rapid Intake's main product, an eLearning authoring tool,\u00a0which eventually lead to Rapid Intake's acquisition in 2011 by Callidus Software.</p><p>In addition to JavaScript technologies, I have\u00a0dabbled in other web technologies such as ActionScript, ASP, PHP, HTML, and CSS.<br></p>",

    "Bio": "<p>Stop hiding unwanted things in mist (Jordan Peterson, Beyond Order). Shake off the dead weight that slows you down. </p><p>Your time is limited, and you have other things going on in your life. More likely than not, you will only get busier as time goes by. </p><p>New technologies show up everyday. Existing ones keep upgrading, adopting new features, switching to new syntaxes. </p><p>For you to stay relevant, you have to keep learning. </p><p>Most importantly, you must do so quickly and easily, without spending too much time or making too much effort. Otherwise, you won't keep up with the rapid tech progress, and your life as a programmer would be too painful as you are constantly struggling with learning something new. </p><p>It seems that you are caught in a dilemma where there is a lot to learn but not enough time to do it. </p><p>The programming world emphasizes reusing codes. You, as a programmer, must \"reuse\" learning experience. The experience of learning one programming technology should enable you to pick up another one with less time and effort. </p><p>In order to do so, you must disperse the mist and remove all the \"unwanted things\" you hide there. </p><p>The \"unwanted things hidden in the mist\" are the insufficient understanding of a coding language or framework. You have never dug deep enough, all you have done is copying what the manual says. When things get complicated, you won't be able to come up with a solution. </p>",

    "Bio": "<p>Hi Everyone!</p><p>I am super excited to be here among the most well-known and vibrant community on the planet. Udemy is all about knowledge and how to utilize in an efficient manner.</p><p>Well, I don't come from a Computer Science or Software Engineering kind of background. I have studied Mechanical Engineering. But, due to my passion and love for coding, I got into programming right after I graduated.</p><p>I come from a very poor family and country and it is very hard to find quality education in Afghanistan especially in the CS/SE field. You can imagine how hard it has been to get to where I am today. After I came back to my country,<strong> I started teaching Web Development with the goal of helping those who love to code, who love to create something amazing but are unable because of their circumstances. </strong></p><p>After almost 5 years of coding and teaching, I thought it was time to up my game, and step into big leagues to target international students, and there is no better platform to start and grow with than Udemy.</p><p><strong>I have published six volumes of Microsoft Office Tutorial Books locally in two provinces of Afghanistan. I believe in life-long learning and I am here to be a part of it with Udemy globally.</strong></p><p>I really appreciate you taking the time to read this and deciding whether or not to choose my courses.<strong> Your support will help me create more courses internationally and extend my reach in Afghanistan as well.</strong></p><p>Thank you so much</p><p><strong>:)</strong></p><p>Love from Afghanistan</p><p><strong>Muslim Helalee</strong></p>",

These things may prove to be very very important in several fields: software engineering, research and development or investment banking.
